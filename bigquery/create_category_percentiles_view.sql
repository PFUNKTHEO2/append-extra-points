-- CREATE CATEGORY PERCENTILES VIEW - v2.1
-- ============================================================================
-- Updated 2025-12-18:
--   - Level uses DIRECT TIER MAPPING from DL_league_category_points (NHL=99, CHL/NL=95, etc.)
--   - Visibility uses DIRECT F01 SCALING (1-99 based on EP views, not percentile)
--
-- Adds percentile rankings (0-100) for each category within peer groups
-- Peer group = same birth_year + position
--
-- Category → Factor Mapping:
-- | Category     | Factors                           | Formula                                        |
-- |--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
-- | Performance  | F03-F12                           | PERCENT_RANK of f03+...+f12                    |
-- | Level        | Direct from league tier           | DL_league_category_points.level_category_points|
-- | Visibility   | F01 (EP Views)                    | Direct scale: 1 + (F01/2000) * 98 → 1-99       |
-- | Achievements | F15-F17, F21, F22                 | PERCENT_RANK of f15+f16+f17+f21+f22           |
-- | Physical     | F02, F26, F27                     | PERCENT_RANK of f02+f26+f27                   |
-- | Trending     | F18, F19                          | PERCENT_RANK of f18+f19                       |
